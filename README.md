# Telecom Classifier Machine Learning

This notebook performs a brief EDA on a telecommunications dataset.

And then tests three types of model (DecisionTree, RandomForest, LogisticRegression) with different hyperparameters.

The target is to obtain a model with good accuracy to predict the best telecommunication plan for each client based on their data.
